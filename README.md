# ANN-and-Handling-imbalanced-data
This notebook demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting customer churn. Additionally, the notebook addresses the challenges of imbalanced data using various techniques such as undersampling, oversampling, SMOTE, and ensemble methods with undersampling.

# Contents
1. Data Exploration:
   - Understanding the customer churn dataset.
   - Exploring features and target variables.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - Handling missing values and categorical variables.
   - Encoding categorical variables.
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

3. Imbalanced Data Handling:
   - Undersampling: Reducing the number of samples in the majority class.
   - Oversampling: Increasing the number of samples in the minority class.
   - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generating synthetic samples for the minority class.
   - Ensemble with Undersampling: Combining multiple models with undersampled data.

4. ANN Model Building:
   - Designing and training an Artificial Neural Network for customer churn prediction.

5. Model Evaluation:
   - Assessing the performance of the model on the test set.
